Use `LevelBuilder.cs` to generate level files to test the code (or your own). 

- Create a new empty GameObject in your scene, add LevelBuilder to it

- Create prefabs for:

  - TargetBox

  - ExplosiveBox

  - Projectile (with SpringJoint2D and ProjectileThrower components)

  - Ground (with a BoxCollider2D)

- Drag these prefabs into the corresponding fields in the LevelBuilder component.
